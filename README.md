This is a simple PowerShell Script for installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux without using the Microsoft Store.

This repository contains two files:
- wsl-easy-one-click-run-as-admin.cmd
This file is a simple file for easily running the PowerShell Script as Administrator.

This scripts contains the OS selection and the auto-install options.

The following Linux Operations Systems are supported by this script:

2. Run the wsl-easy-one-click-run-as-admin.cmd as administrator
